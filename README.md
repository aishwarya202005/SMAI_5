## neural networks
1. Train and validate your own n-layer Neural Network on the Apparel dataset to predict the class label of a given apparel. You are free to choose the hyper-parameters,
training strategy to handle large number of training data (Hint: Batch Size) architecture - number of hidden layers, number of nodes in each hidden layer etc.<br>
• Tasks:<br>
◦ Play with your neural network to report the best performing architecture for the given task. Also, include the activation function, loss function used in the
report.<br>
◦ Contrast the effect of using different activation functions on the validation data. Use ReLU, Sigmoid & Tanh as activation functions in the hidden layers.

<br>
◦ Report how the number of layers affects the performances of the model. Plot number of layers vs prediction loss graph.<br>
◦ Show how error is dependent on the number of epochs with appropriate plots.<br>

2. Consider the House Price Prediction dataset. Predict the Sale Price of a house and for the task you want to use a neural network with 3 hidden layers. Write a report on how you would modify above neural network for such task with proper reasoning.
